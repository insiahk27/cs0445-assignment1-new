There are no errors.

Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):
For specifically the subsequence(), when I run the code on 
my terminal, the output is exactly the same as the output given 
on the A1Out.txt but when I turn it in on gradescope, it gives me 
the error that it didn't pass one of the tests.
